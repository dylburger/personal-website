[Should It Be A Meeting?](https://shoulditbeameeting.com/#/) was a fun weekend project we developed at MailCoach to help people think twice about scheduling meetings.

We were the #5 Product of the Day on [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/should-it-be-a-meeting) the day we launched, reaching thousands of users.
