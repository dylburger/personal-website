I developed [MailCoach](https://www.mailcoachapp.com/) to help people spend less time in email. We used data on your habits in email (e.g. what emails you read, what senders you responded to) to programmatically suggest filters so emails you didn't need to read would skip your inbox.

The core web app was written in React. All of the backend services were serverless (API Gateway / Lambda / DynamoDB / Kinesis).
